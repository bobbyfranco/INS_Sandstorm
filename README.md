# Insurgency Sandstorm Advanced Server Launcher
This is an advanced server launcher I cooked up to streamline the process of setting up your dedicated server for Insurgency Sandstorm with more flexibility and less typing. Below are the listed features:

[1] Gamemode/Team/Map/Mutator Selection (I have yet to add all game modes)

[2] Assign server address, server name, max players, and enable/disable cheats.

[3] Assign a password for your server.

[4] Toggle between Day/Night

[5] Parse IP (adds -MultiHome to launch command)

[6] Generate MapCycle.txt for selected gamemode.

[7] Create an MOTD.

[8] Assign server admins.

[9] Add server authentication and game stats via tokens.

[10] Save/load configuration for quick setup and launch.


My future plans for this project are:

Add all game modes.

Add mod support.
