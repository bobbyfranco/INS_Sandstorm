# Insurgency Sandstorm Advanced Server Launcher
This is an advanced server launcher I cooked up to streamline the process of setting up your dedicated server for Insurgency Sandstorm with more flexibility and less typing. Below are the listed features:

Gamemode/Team/Map/Mutator Selection (I have yet to add all game modes)
Assign server address, server name, max players, and enable/disable cheats.
Assign a password for your server.
Toggle between Day/Night
Parse IP (adds -MultiHome to launch command)
Generate MapCycle.txt for selected gamemode.
Create an MOTD.
Assign server admins.
Add server authentication and game stats via tokens.
Save/load configuration for quick setup and launch.

My future plans for this project are:
Add all game modes.
Add mod support.
